<p>The Artificial Intelligence for Design (AI4D) Lab is a research group at the Lyle School of Engineering at Southern Methodist University directed by Prof. Karbasian.</p>
<br>
<p>In AI4D Lab, we use AI/ML to solve complex fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. These fields are the fundamental engineering problems in renewable energy, transportation, biomedical devices, air mobility, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>We are interested in developing novel algorithms, deep learning architectures, and mathematical models to solve inverse problems, bio-inspired designs, and large-scale optimizations.</p>

<p>We develope different software to employ them in our research program and engineering applications. We use our in-house CFD solver (and open-source codes, too) for flow analysis. Furthermore, we have developed a package for optimization called <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/opthinos">OPTHiNOS</a> for sensitivity analysis, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and PDE-constrained optimization for highly nonlinear dynamical systems.</p>
