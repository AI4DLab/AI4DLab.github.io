## PhD students ( [Download flyer](files/PhDposition.pdf) )
-------------
Finishing your Masters degree and interested in computational physics, and solving complex problems in design and optimization using scientific machine learning? The AI4D Lab has multiple fully-funded PhD positions.

The ideal candidate must meet the following options:
1. Have a Masters degree in Mechanical, Aerospace, Applied Mathematics, or Physics related to fluid dynamics.
2. Have hands-on experience in AI/ML, reduced-order modeling, and computational methods.
3. Experience in programming with Python, Julia, or C++.
4. Good knowledge of fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, and turbulence.
5. Experience in CFD software development or good knowledge of algorithms in CFD methods.  

If you meet the aforementioned options, you should email a cover letter and CV to Prof. Karbasian ([karbasian@mit.edu](karbasian@mit.edu)) with the subject "PhD Application - SML", otherwise your email might not be seen.

## Undergrad students
-------------
Undergraduate students who are interested in working in the AI4D Lab should directly contact Prof. Karbasian ([karbasian@mit.edu](karbasian@mit.edu)) with a brief statement of their interests and background. Note that the subject of your email must be "Undergrad Application - SML", otherwise your email might not be seen.


## Post-doctoral fellows
-------------
Currently, we do not have hiring, while prospective postdocs are always welcome to get in touch with Prof. Karbasian to consider existing fellowships.

## Visiting scholars
-------------
Interested in sharpening your knowledge in design and optimization in fluid engineering problems? AI4D Lab is always looking forward to collaborating with talented researchers and students. For more information, please contact Prof. Karbasian ([karbasian@mit.edu](karbasian@mit.edu)) with the subject "Visiting Scholar - SML".
